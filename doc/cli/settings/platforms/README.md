# Define platforms for hosting virtual machines (vorteil settings platforms)

Platform is the generic term we use to mean anything that we support
provisioning virtual machines to. This includes local hypervisors such as
VirtualBox and QEMU-KVM, as well as complex cloud and infrastructure environments
such as Amazon's AWS, Google's Cloud Platform, and VMware's VCenter.

Platforms used by the 'run' and 'provision' commands can be selected by either
changing the default platform or by using the '--platform' flag with those
commands.
