## Get a Project
The best way to get a project to use on the Developer Studo would be to add the repository Marketplace which contains a 'helloworld' application.

Via the actions panel there will be a '+' icon which pops open a modal which displays a repository form like the one below. 

![New Repo](https://storage.googleapis.com/vorteil-dl/assets/documentation/newrepo.png "New Repo Screenshot")

By entering a name for the repository and the address of marketplace.vorteil.io and hitting add we should now have a one letter character based on the name you gave the repository in the actions panel. 

To get a project from here dive into a bucket and find an application you would like to run. Right click the application and go 'Export as Project'. Then you will need to provide a directory where you would like to save the project. Upon completion a new project should appear in the tree named around the application you exported.
