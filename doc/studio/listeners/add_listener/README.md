# Adding a Listener
A listener is very easy to add to the daemon. Just head to the 'Settings' page and right down the bottom there will be a listener form. The listener form asks for the details listed below
```
    Name   | What the daemon can refer to the listener as.
    URL    | Where to send the request when it is triggered.
    Method | What method would you like to use when sending this request.
    Headers| The key value pair on the right hand side is how you attach headers to the request that gets triggered.
    Body   | The body of the request you can pass valid json.
    ```
