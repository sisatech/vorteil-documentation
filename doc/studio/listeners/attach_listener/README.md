# Attaching a Listener 
After creating a simple listener go to the local repository and find the application you wish to attach this to. Right click 'Add Listener' select the one you wish to add and click on 'Add'.

The best way to check if this has been properly attached is to right click on the application again and go to 'Remove Listener'. If it is in the list then its properly attached to the application.

To remove the listener from the application is the same as when you tried to add a listener.
