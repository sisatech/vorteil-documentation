# Uploading Applications to the Local Repository
Uploading applications to the local repository can be acheived through the Command-Line Interface (CLI), the Developer Studio, or the GraphQL API. The focus of this document will be to demonstrate the process of uploading an application to a Vorteil Repository using the CLI.

```bash
$ vorteil upload BUCKET_NAME/APP_NAME [BUILDABLE]
```
*Note: If the bucket / app do not already exist within the repository, they will be automatically created.*
