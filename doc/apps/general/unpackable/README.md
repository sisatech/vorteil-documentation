# What is 'UNPACKABLE'?

The CLI and API both sometimes ask for something 'unpackable' as an argument. What they're really asking for is anything that the service 
can understand and turn into a Vorteil project. This includes the following types of sources. See their respective pages for information about how to provide them as a string argument.

* Vorteil Package 
* [Vorteil Project](../../projects/introduction)
* ELF64 Binary
* Vorteil Repository URL
