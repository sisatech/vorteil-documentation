# Get a Project

Projects can be manually created and built by users, or extracted from existing Vorteil application packages, such as those found on the official [Vorteil Marketplace](https://marketplace.vorteil.io).


To connect to the Vorteil Marketplace with the Developer Studio, left-click on the '+' icon within the application sidebar. This will open a modal which prompts the user for information:

![New Repo](https://storage.googleapis.com/vorteil-dl/assets/documentation/newrepo.png "New Repo Screenshot")

Leave the dropdown menu set as 'No Auth', and name the repository as desired (for example: 'marketplace'). In the second text input field, enter the address at which the repository is located: `https://marketplace.vorteil.io`.

To finish this process, click the 'Add' button.
A new icon will appear in the application sidebar; clicking on this will reveal a list of accessible applications hosted within the newly-added repository. Right-click on any application within the repository, and select 'Export as Project'.

Once the process is complete, the new project will appear in the projects list.
