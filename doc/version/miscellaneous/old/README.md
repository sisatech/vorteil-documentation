# Documentation for Old Releases

The official Vorteil support portal (support.vorteil.io) does not keep versioned
documentation, but the content on the portal is periodically synchronized with 
the latest commit to a publically accessible 
[Git project](https://github.com/sisatech/vorteil-documentation). To access past
versions of Vorteil's documentation visit the git project and check the commit
history until you find the documentation you're looking for.
