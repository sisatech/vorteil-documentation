# Uni-kernel Approach
Vorteil is not a uni-kernel, but follows a uni-kernel approach. Some of the benefits of this approach include:

- Startup times measurable in milliseconds.
- Tiny footprint (due to very small overhead).
- Increased level of security (no ssh/ssl means fewer attack surfaces).
- Optimization: specifically configure applicaitons to use only the resources they require (virtual machines with 32MiB of RAM are possible)!
