# Immutable Infrastructure
Vorteil applications are immutable; the servers are never modified once deployed. Instead, they are removed and replaced. This immutability provides multiple benefits, as listed below:

- Virtual Machines behave more predictably and consistently. 
- Simplified deployment process.
- Once a virtual machine and it's disk have been deleted, there is no way for any third parties to access that data anymore.

Thanks to an immutable approach, the process of replacing dead servers, or scaling according to traffic/demand, is far more simple; the process should always remain the same!
