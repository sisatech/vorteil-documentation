## What is Vorteil?

With Vorteil, your applications can be run as standalone virtual machines without any of the bulky overhead that virtual machines typically require. Vorteil's 'unikernel'-like approach provides a smaller attack surface (no shell / ssh) and immutable infrastructure, resulting in advanced security and scalability. 

Each virtual machine runs only a single app. Without an operating system there is nothing to attack except for the application itself, putting the security of your applications entirely in your hands. 

The Vorteil toolset has been designed from the very beginning to integrate into existing software development life cycles, and works with mature off-the-shelf software, too! Using our Command-Line Interface (CLI), build any 64-bit Linux program into ready-to-use image formats, deployable to all major cloud providers / in-house datacenters.
