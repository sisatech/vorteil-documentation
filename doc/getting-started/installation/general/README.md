# General Installation

How to perform a typical Vorteil installation.

## Get the Installer

Head to [vorteil.io](http://vorteil.io) and scroll down until the installer download links are visible. Click on the download link most appropriate to your operating system. Once the download is complete, run the installer with administrator privileges to continue. The installer will then guide users through the installation process.

It is possible to run the installer in 'unattended' mode by providing the flag "-mode unattended". 

## After Installing

It is recommended that users restart their system following a fresh installation.
