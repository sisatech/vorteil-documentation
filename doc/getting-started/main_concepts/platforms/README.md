# Platforms

Within the Vorteil ecosystem, 'platform' is a term that refers to any support deployment target, whether it's a local hypervisor, a remote cloud platform, or an in-house datacenter.

Adding and configuring a platform is easy to do, and can be done with the Command-Line Interface, Developer Studio, or API. Once added, deploying or provisioning Virtual Machines to the platform is a simple 1 line command (or right-click, 'deploy')!

Additionally, the Vorteil ecosystem supports exporting applications to multiple disk formats (such as VMDK, RAW, and OVA).
